TIE-Outlet (MEAN Stack) - MongoDB / Express.Js / Angular / Node.Js

If you want to test it on your own : Angular CLI 8.2.0 min

You will probably need "Windows build tools" directly installed on your PowerShell for modules like bcrypt to work
and you'll need an account on mongoDB with MongoDB Compass installed on your machine

Once you'll get that on the app.js file, you'll have to replace (<username> / <password>) with yours <== That will be your own credentials.
and you'll have to replace (<database>) by the name you want to give your database name's collection  
                                                                                                           
After this, based on the models inside the backend files ; create your own data on MongoDB and connect yourself on the Outlet to test the functionnality
